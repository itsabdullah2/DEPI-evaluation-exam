    1 - Void elements

    2 - "em" takes its value from the parent element, "rem" takes its value from the html, "px" it's a static unit and "rem", "em" are relative units.

    3 - "button" Can contain any HTML content within it, it's flexible. "input" not flexible working with, I can use it in a simple situation, at the end it's a self closing tag element

    4- "Hoisting" is a javascript mechanism where variables and function declarations move to the top of their scope before code execution.
        "Event Loop" The event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that manages the execution of code, especially in asynchronous operations. JavaScript is   single-threaded, so it can only do one thing at a time. The event loop works in conjunction with the call stack and the callback queue to manage the  execution of code.

    5 - "for .. in" is used to iterate over the keys of an object, while "for .. of" is used to iterate over the values of an object.
        "do .. while" loop ensures at least a singular iteration will happen.
